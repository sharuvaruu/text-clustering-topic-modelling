# Clustering Textual Data

## Project Overview

This project focuses on clustering textual data into meaningful groups based on content similarity. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and clustering algorithms to analyze and categorize text data effectively.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes NLP techniques for cleaning and preparing text data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transforms text data into numerical features using methods such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implements clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group similar texts together.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representations of clusters to aid in understanding the groupings and their characteristics.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-clustering.git
cd text-clustering
pip install -r requirements.txt
